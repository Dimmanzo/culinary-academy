- All functions of the website have been thoroughly tested on various screen sizes and  to ensure seamless performance across different devices.

- All functions of the website have been tested across multiple browsers, including: Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, Opera.

- After testing website with a lighthouse tool I noticed that performance was below 80%, so had to spend some time finding ways to increase that. Compressing images and preloading them fixed the problem.
